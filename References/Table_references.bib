abstract = {Between June 1968 and November 1971, 21 months of fieldwork were spent studying wild populations of orang-utans in Borneo and Sumatra. Fifteen hundred hours of daylight observation were made on these animals. In contrast to other higher primates, the dispersed distribution of food and the orang-utan's slow mode of travel seem to favour solitary habits. Over, 80 per cent of foraging units seen contined only one independent animal, either alone or with dependent young. Larger groupings were seen when adolescents joined up with other animals or when males and females formed temporary consortships for mating purposes. Comparison between several populations revealed an interesting mechanisms for the natural regulation of animal numbers. Differences between Bornean and Sumatran orang-utans are discussed in relation to the zoogeography of these two islands. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

At the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project study area in the Tanjung Puting Reserve, Central Indonesian Borneo, adult males were calling more regularly and frequently than reported from other areas in Borneo. Adult males also exhibited a behavior, not reported elsewhere, sometimes associated with the vocalization of long calls: the pushing over of large snags (branchless dead trees) to the ground. At Tanjung Puting long calls functioned primarily to mediate dominance relationships among adult males who rarely came into direct contact with one another. In addition, long calls may have been helping sexually receptive females locate males.},

abstract = {Long calls given by adult male orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) have been hypothesized to mediate interindividual spacing among male orangutans and to attract female orangutans, to high-ranking mates over long distances. To test these two hypotheses I conducted observations of calling behaviour and a series of experimental playbacks of recorded long calls. The findings were consistent with the male-spacing hypothesis but did not support the mate-attraction hypothesis. Experimental playbacks demonstrate that long calls regulate spacing between males through an approach-avoidance system based on dominance relationships: the highest-ranking adult male approaches calls, while lower-ranking, males avoid calls. The results of playbacks also reveal that sexually active females do not move toward long calls, and therefore do not indicate that long calls function in attracting mates. This latter finding suggests that female mate choice may not have been an important selective factor during the evolution of long calls. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

Males that gave calls more often were more likely to approach calls by others. Results bolster a female attraction function of long calls. Flanged males did not significantly avoid or approach long calls. However, males called more when alone than when guarding a female mate, and adult females significantly approached long calls, especially those of the dominant male, and did so regardless of their reproductive state, allowing them to remain within earshot of calling males. The possible selective advantages of this response include avoidance of harassment and infanticide by males.

abstract = {Researchers have documented individual vocal recognition in several primate species but do not know whether the changes in acoustical parameters that might occur over distance influence the informational content of a call that relates to individuality. Accordingly, we performed playback experiments using male orangutan long-distance calls (long calls) and rerecorded them at increasing distances from the source. We aimed to determine 1) which acoustical parameters changed over distance and 2) whether the percentage of calls that a discriminant analyses would assign to the correct individual would change over distance. High-frequency harmonics were attenuated and lost with increasing distance, but other parameters did not change. The percentage of calls assigned to the correct individual did not change over distance, indicating that even though there are some acoustical changes over distance the opportunity for other individuals to recognize the caller remains similar until ≤300 m, which was the maximum distance at which we rerecorded calls. Extending similar experiments to other primate species and other taxa, while subsequently conducting experiments to assess whether individual discrimination by receivers is indeed based on relatively stable acoustical parameters, would forward our understanding of acoustic communication.},

abstract = {Long calls by flanged male Bornean orang-utans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) serve as a long-distance communication signal in this semi-solitary species and allow individuals to adjust their ranging behavior. Long calls can be heard up to circa 1 km in dense rainforest. Only flanged males emit them, in various contexts: spontaneously (where no disturbances from the environment are perceived by human observers), when highly aroused by another male's long call or a falling tree nearby, or right after having pushed over a dead tree themselves. In this study, acoustic analyses of orang-utan long calls at Tuanan in Central Kalimantan not only confirm the discrimination of individual males by their long calls but also demonstrate the discrimination of context based on the long calls' acoustic structure, which is further supported by the females' ranging responses according to long call contexts. Females with dependent offspring move away from spontaneous long call sources but appear to ignore long calls elicited by disturbance. Hence, Bornean orang-utan females perceive measurable differences in acoustic characteristics of long calls given in different contexts. These findings concur with vocal discrimination of contexts in other non-human primates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {Monkey alarm calls have shown that in the primate clade, combinatorial rules in acoustic communication are not exclusive to humans. A recent hypothesis suggests that the number of different call combinations in monkeys increases with increased number of predator species. However, the existence of combinatorial rules in great ape alarm calls remains largely unstudied, despite its obvious relevance to ideas about the evolution of human speech. In this paper, we examine the potential use of combinatorial rules in the alarm calls of the only Asian great ape: the orangutan. Alarm calls in orangutans are composed of syllables (with either one or two distinct elements), which in turn are organized into sequences. Tigers and clouded leopards are predators for Sumatran orangutans, but in Borneo, tigers are extinct. Thus, orangutans make a suitable great ape model to assess alarm call composition in relation to the size of the predator guild. We exposed orangutans on both islands to a tiger and control model. Response compositionality was analyzed at two levels (i.e., syllable and syllable sequences) between models and populations. Results were corroborated using information theory algorithms. We made specific, directed predictions for the variation expected if orangutans used combinatorial rules. None of these predictions were met, indicating that monkey alarm call combinatorial rules do not have direct homologues in orangutans. If these results are replicated in other great apes, this indicates that predation did not drive selection towards ever more combinatorial rules in the human lineage.},

abstract = {One of the most apparent discontinuities between non-human primate (primate) call communication and human speech concerns repertoire size. The former is essentially fixed to a limited number of innate calls, while the latter essentially consists of numerous learned components. Consequently, primates are thought to lack laryngeal control required to produce learned voiced calls. However, whether they may produce learned voiceless calls awaits investigation. Here, a case of voiceless call learning in primates is investigated - orangutan (Pongo spp.) whistling. In this study, all known whistling orangutans are inventoried, whistling-matching tests (previously conducted with one individual) are replicated with another individual using original test paradigms, and articulatory and acoustic whistle characteristics are compared between three orangutans. Results show that whistling has been reported for ten captive orangutans. The test orangutan correctly matched human whistles with significantly high levels of performance. Whistle variation between individuals indicated voluntary control over the upper lip, lower lip, and respiratory musculature, allowing individuals to produce learned voiceless calls. Results are consistent with inter- and intra-specific social transmission in whistling orangutans. Voiceless call learning in orangutans implies that some important components of human speech learning and control were in place before the homininae-ponginae evolutionary split. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Arbitrariness is an elementary feature of human language, yet seldom an object of comparative inquiry. While arbitrary signals for the same function are relatively frequent between animal populations across taxa, the same signal with arbitrary functions is rare and it remains unknown whether, in parallel with human speech, it may involve call production in animals. To investigate this question, we examined a particular orangutan alarm call – the kiss-squeak – and two variants – hand and leaf kiss-squeaks. In Tuanan (Central Kalimantan, Indonesia), the acoustic frequency of unaided kiss-squeaks is negatively related to body size. The modified variants are correlated with perceived threat and are hypothesized to increase the perceived body size of the sender, as the use of a hand or leaves lowers the kiss-squeak's acoustic frequency. We examined the use of these variants in the same context in another orangutan population of the same sub-species and with partially similar habitat at Cabang Panti (West Kalimantan, Indonesia). Identical analyses of data from this site provided similar results for unaided kiss-squeaks but dissimilar results for hand and leaf kiss-squeaks. Unaided kiss-squeaks at Cabang Panti were emitted as commonly and showed the same relationship to body size as in Tuanan. However, at Cabang Panti, hand kiss-squeaks were extremely rare, while leaf-use neither conveyed larger body size nor was related to perceived threat. These findings indicate functional discontinuity between the two sites and therefore imply functional arbitrariness of leaf kiss-squeaks. These results show for the first time the existence of animal signals involving call production with arbitrary function. Our findings are consistent with previous studies arguing that these orangutan call variants are socially learned and reconcile the role of gestures and calls within evolutionary theories based on common ancestry for speech and music.},

abstract = {The evolutionary origins of speech remain obscure. Recently, it was proposed that speech derived from monkey facial signals which exhibit a speech-like rhythm of ∼5 open-close lip cycles per second. In monkeys, these signals may also be vocalized, offering a plausible evolutionary stepping stone towards speech. Three essential predictions remain, however, to be tested to assess this hypothesis' validity; (i) Great apes, our closest relatives, should likewise produce 5Hz-rhythm signals, (ii) speech-like rhythm should involve calls articulatorily similar to consonants and vowels given that speech rhythm is the direct product of stringing together these two basic elements, and (iii) speech-like rhythm should be experience-based. Via cinematic analyses we demonstrate that an ex-entertainment orangutan produces two calls at a speech-like rhythm, coined "clicks" and "faux-speech." Like voiceless consonants, clicks required no vocal fold action, but did involve independent manoeuvring over lips and tongue. In parallel to vowels, faux-speech showed harmonic and formant modulations, implying vocal fold and supralaryngeal action. This rhythm was several times faster than orangutan chewing rates, as observed in monkeys and humans. Critically, this rhythm was seven-fold faster, and contextually distinct, than any other known rhythmic calls described to date in the largest database of the orangutan repertoire ever assembled. The first two predictions advanced by this study are validated and, based on parsimony and exclusion of potential alternative explanations, initial support is given to the third prediction. Irrespectively of the putative origins of these calls and underlying mechanisms, our findings demonstrate irrevocably that great apes are not respiratorily, articulatorilly, or neurologically constrained for the production of consonant- and vowel-like calls at speech rhythm. Orangutan clicks and faux-speech confirm the importance of rhythmic speech antecedents within the primate lineage, and highlight potential articulatory homologies between great ape calls and human consonants and vowels.},

abstract = {Why did our ancestors combine the first consonant- and vowel-like utterances to produce the first syllable or word? To answer this question, it is essential to know what constituted the communicative function of proto-consonants and of proto-vowels before their combined use became universal. Almost nothing is known, however, about consonant-like calls in the primate order1,2. Here, we investigate a large collection of voiceless consonant-like calls in nonhuman great apes (our closest relatives), namely orangutans (Pongo spp.). We analysed 4,486 kiss-squeaks collected across 48 individuals in four wild populations. Despite idiosyncratic production mechanics, consonant-like calls displayed information-dense content and the same acoustic signatures found in voiced vowel-like calls by nonhuman primates, implying similar biological functions. Selection regimes between proto-consonants and proto-vowels were thus probably indistinguishable at the dawn of spoken language evolution. Our findings suggest that the first proto-syllables or proto-words in our lineage probably constituted message reiterations, instead of messages of increasing intricacy. Orangutan kiss-squeaks — voiceless consonant-like calls — exhibit rich acoustic variation and clear acoustic signature, conveying information about population, size class, context and individual identity.},

abstract = {The origin of language is one of the most significant evolutionary milestones of life on Earth, but one of the most persevering scientific unknowns. Two decades ago, game theorists and mathematicians predicted that the first words and grammar emerged as a response to transmission errors and information loss in language's precursor system, however, empirical proof is lacking. Here, we assessed information loss in proto-consonants and proto-vowels in human pre-linguistic ancestors as proxied by orangutan consonant-like and vowel-like calls that compose syllable-like combinations. We played back and re-recorded calls at increasing distances across a structurally complex habitat (i.e. adverse to sound transmission). Consonant-like and vowel-like calls degraded acoustically over distance, but no information loss was detected regarding three distinct classes of information (viz. individual ID, context and population ID). Our results refute prevailing mathematical predictions and herald a turning point in language evolution theory and heuristics. Namely, explaining how the vocal-verbal continuum was crossed in the hominid family will benefit from future mathematical and computational models that, in order to enjoy empirical validity and superior explanatory power, will be informed by great ape behaviour and repertoire.},

abstract = {Mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) give double‐grunts to one another in a variety of situations, when feeding, resting, moving, or engaged in other kinds of social behavior. Some double‐grunts elicit double‐grunts in reply whereas others do not. Double‐grunts are individually distinctive, and high‐ranking animals give double‐grunts at higher rates than others. There was no evidence, however, that the probability of eliciting a reply depended upon either the animals' behavior at the time a call was given or the social relationship between caller and respondent. The probability of eliciting a reply could be predicted from a double‐grunt's acoustic features. Gorillas apparently produce at least two acoustically different subtypes of double‐grunts, each of which conveys different information. Double‐grunts with a low second formant (typically < 1600 Hz) are given by animals after a period of silence and frequently elicit vocal replies. Double‐grunts with a high second formant (typically > 1600 Hz) are given by animals within 5 s of a call from another individual and rarely elicit replies. {\textcopyright} 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {Animal signals have been interpreted as indicating something about the signaller's internal state and hence its subsequent behaviour, while at the same time eliciting a response from the receiver. Such signals are often given when the costs and benefits of an action depend on what others do. This interpretation of meaning and function of signals has been applied primarily to ritualized competitive or courtship displays. Here we use the approach to analyse another context of signalling and a more subtle communicatory behaviour. Gorillas live in small cohesive groups whose synchronized activities alternate between travel/ feeding periods and resting periods. We present data on gorillas' vocalizations - the grunts - prior to a coordinated departure from a rest period. We suggest that gorillas use these signals to indicate their readiness to depart and to assess that readiness in others. Vocal activity increased significantly towards the end of rest periods, due both to individuals calling at higher rates, and to a greater number of vocalizers. This increase in vocal activity was not associated with a greater clumping of animals, nor with an increase in non-rest activities, and therefore appeared to be related to subsequent departure. The frequent exchange of grunts supports the notion that gorillas might use the calls of others to assess their readiness to depart. We speculate that such signalling could function to synchronize the behaviour of group members and lead to coordinated group movement.},

abstract = {Despite considerable interest in the vocal communication of non-human primates and its possible relevance to theories of language evolution, we know surprisingly little about how vocal communication varies between closely related species inhabiting differing environments. Here, we provide the first quantitative description of the vocal repertoire, calling rates, and call usage in wild western gorillas and compare it to the previous work on mountain gorilla vocal behavior. During 1572 h of focal follows (n = 533), we collected behavioral data on and recorded vocalizations (n = 2163) of eight individuals in one group at Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo). We supplemented these data with opportunistic recordings of an additional adult male in a second group. We used discriminant function analysis to test how well calls can be categorized by their acoustic structure and used behavioral data to determine the typical usage of western gorilla call types. The vocal repertoire comprised of 17 call types. Twelve of 17 call types were given primarily in a single context. Our results were similar to previous studies of mountain gorillas in that grunts, and grumbles were used most frequently and the silverback male vocalized more frequently than other group members. However, compared to mountain gorillas, western gorillas used an additional call type (sex-whinny), used a second call type (hoot series) in a completely different context and by all age-sex classes, and used many more call types in a more context-specific fashion. Our study suggests that although vocal production is highly constrained by morphology and phylogeny, differing social and ecological conditions can yield differences in the use and function of calls, even between two closely related species such as western and mountain gorillas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {The use of loud vocal signals to reduce distance among separated social partners is well documented in many species; however, the underlying mechanisms by which the reduction of spacing occurs and how they differ across species remain unclear. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) offer an opportunity to investigate these issues because their vocal repertoire includes a loud, long-distance call (i.e., hoot series) that is potentially used in within-group communication, whereas mountain gorillas use an identical call exclusively during intergroup encounters. First, we tested whether the hoot series functions as a contact/separation call. Second, we examined which individuals were more likely to reply and which party was more responsible for decreasing distance to identify the underlying mechanisms and cognitive implications of hoot series. We collected behavioral, spatial, and acoustic data on five adult gorillas over 15 months at the Mondika Research Center (Republic of Congo and CAR). Hoot series are individually distinct calls and given by both male and female gorillas when separated from each other. Following hooting, the distance between separated group members decreased significantly; thus we concluded that western gorillas use this call to reestablish group cohesion. The way in which proximity was achieved depended upon listeners replying or not to the caller. Replies may indicate a conflict between callers about intended travel direction, with vocal interchanges serving to negotiate a consensus. Although the acoustic features of vocal signals are highly constrained in closely related species, our results demonstrate that the function and usage of particular calls can be flexible.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the functioning of a species' vocal repertoire can be greatly improved by investigating acoustic variation and using objective classification schemes based on acoustic structure. Here we used a syntactic approach to investigate the acoustic structure of the gorilla close distance vocalizations ('close calls'), which remain as yet little understood. We examined 2130 calls of 10 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, and 5 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) from Bai Hokou, Central African Republic. We segmented calls into units using distinct acoustic features and employed model-based cluster analyses to define the repertoire of unit types. We then examined how unit types were combined into calls. Lastly, we compared unit type use between age-sex classes and the two study groups. We found that the gorilla close calls consist of 5 intergraded acoustic unit types which were flexibly but yet non-randomly concatenated into 159 combinations. Our results are in line with previous quantitative acoustic analyses demonstrating a high degree of acoustic variation in a variety of animal vocal repertoires, particularly close distance vocalizations. Our findings add on to (1) the recent argument that the common practice of describing vocal repertoires as either discrete or graded may be of little value as such distinctions may be driven by human perception and non-quantitative descriptions of vocal repertoires, and (2) recent studies indicating that flexibility in close range social calls can come about through combinatorial systems, which previously have been studied primarily in long distance vocalizations. Furthermore, our study highlights differences in the vocal repertoire of western and mountain gorillas, as expected given differences in environment and social behaviour. Our results offer opportunities for further in-depth studies investigating the function of the gorilla close calls, which will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of ape vocal communication in general. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

We examined a large video corpus of Koko and observed 439 VBBs spread across 161 bouts. Our analysis shows that Koko exercises voluntary control over the performance of nine distinctive VBBs, which involve variable coordination of her breathing, larynx, and supralaryngeal articulators like the tongue and lips. Each of these behaviors is performed in the context of particular manual action routines and gestures. Based on these and other findings, we suggest that vocal learning and the ability to exercise volitional control over vocalization, particularly in a multimodal context, might have figured relatively early into the evolution of language, with some rudimentary capacity in place at the time of our last common ancestor with great apes.},

abstract = {Many nonhuman primates produce food-associated vocalizations upon encountering or ingesting particular food. Concerning the great apes, only food-associated vocalizations of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) have been studied in detail, providing evidence that these vocalizations can be produced flexibly in relation to a variety of factors, such as the quantity and quality of food and/or the type of audience. Only anecdotal evidence exists of eastern (Gorilla beringei) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) producing food-associated vocalizations, termed singing or humming. To enable a better understanding of the context in which these calls are produced, we investigated and compared the vocal behavior of two free-ranging groups of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) at Mondika, Republic of Congo. Our results show that (a) food-associated call production occurs only during feeding and not in other contexts; (b) calling is not uniformly distributed across age and sex classes; (c) calls are only produced during feeding on specific foods; and (d) normally just one individual gives calls during group feeding sessions, however, certain food types elicit simultaneous calling of two or more individuals. Our findings provide new insight into the vocal abilities of gorillas but also carry larger implications for questions concerning vocal variability among the great apes. Food-associated calls of nonhuman primates have been shown to be flexible in terms of when they are used and who they are directed at, making them interesting vocalizations from the viewpoint of language evolution. Food-associated vocalizations in great apes can offer new opportunities to investigate the phylogenetic development of vocal communication within the primate lineage and can possibly contribute novel insights into the origins of human language.},

abstract = {The question of whether any species except humans exhibits culture has generated much debate, partially due to the difficulty of providing conclusive evidence from observational studies in the wild. A starting point for demonstrating the existence of culture that has been used for many species including chimpanzees and orangutans is to show that there is geographic variation in the occurrence of particular behavioral traits inferred to be a result of social learning and not ecological or genetic influences. Gorillas live in a wide variety of habitats across Africa and they exhibit flexibility in diet, behavior, and social structure. Here we apply the ‘method of exclusion' to look for the presence/absence of behaviors that could be considered potential cultural traits in well-habituated groups from five study sites of the two species of gorillas. Of the 41 behaviors considered, 23 met the criteria of potential cultural traits, of which one was foraging related, nine were environment related, seven involved social interactions, five were gestures, and one was communication related. There was a strong positive correlation between behavioral dissimilarity and geographic distance among gorilla study sites. Roughly half of all variation in potential cultural traits was intraspecific differences (i.e. variability among sites within a species) and the other 50% of potential cultural traits were differences between western and eastern gorillas. Further research is needed to investigate if the occurrence of these traits is influenced by social learning. These findings emphasize the importance of investigating cultural traits in African apes and other species to shed light on the origin of human culture.},

abstract = {Great apes and siamangs-but not humans-possess laryngeal air sacs, suggesting that they were lost over hominin evolution. The absence of air sacs in humans may hold clues to speech evolution, but little is known about their functions in extant apes. We investigated whether gorillas use their air sacs to produce the staccato 'growling' of the silverback chest beat display. This hypothesis was formulated after viewing a nature documentary showing a display by a silverback western gorilla (Kingo). As Kingo growls, the video shows distinctive vibrations in his chest and throat under which the air sacs extend. We also investigated whether other similarly staccato vocalizations-the whinny, sex whinny, and copulation grunt-might also involve the air sacs. To examine these hypotheses, we collected an opportunistic sample of video and audio evidence from research records and another documentary of Kingo's group, and from videos of other gorillas found on YouTube. Analysis shows that the four vocalizations are each emitted in rapid pulses of a similar frequency (8-16 pulses per second), and limited visual evidence indicates that they may all occur with upper torso vibrations. Future research should determine how consistently the vibrations co-occur with the vocalizations, whether they are synchronized, and their precise location and timing. Our findings fit with the hypothesis that apes-especially, but not exclusively males-use their air sacs for vocalizations and displays related to size exaggeration for sex and territory. Thus changes in social structure, mating, and sexual dimorphism might have led to the obsolescence of the air sacs and their loss in hominin evolution.},

Gorillas produce two of the most conspicuous long-range signals of this type: chest beating and hand clapping. Here we present the first systematic analysis of chest beating (n = 63) and hand clapping (n = 88) in wild western gorillas to assess the behavioral contexts in which they emerged, the flexibility of their use, and the age–sex classes that produced them. Data were collected at the Mondika Research Center, Republic of Congo, from a habituated gorilla group during two separate collection periods (June–August 2007; May 2009–June 2010). Our results show that both signals are highly context specific, with chest beating used only during display and/or play and hand clapping used only during vigilance and/or play. Age–sex classes differed in their use and production of these signals in that immature individuals used both signals only when playing, the male only used chest beating when displaying and never hand clapped, and adult females used both signals flexibly in two contexts instead of one. This study confirms previous anecdotal accounts of loud auditory gestures in western gorillas and adds crucial information on their flexibility across age categories. While chest beating has been described in both gorilla species, hand clapping as a way to communicate potential danger is unique to western gorillas. Further studies should focus on determining the variations in frequency and use across geographically distant populations.},

@article{DeWaal1988,
abstract = {Ten bonobos (Pan paniscus), housed in three separate subgroups at the San Diego Zoological Garden, were observed for 288 hours over a four-month period. The colony included one adult male, two adult females, two adolescent males, four juveniles, and one infant. Data on 5,135 sequences of social behavior were collected either as spoken accounts or as video recordings. In addition, high-quality sound recordings were obtained for spectrographic analysis. The data were subjected to a quantitative analysis of probabilities of association between 44 communicative behavior patterns and 40 different context types. The paper treats each communicative behavior pattern separately, providing a) its frequency, b) the most common inter-individual directions of performance, c) characteristic contexts, d) a description, e) a commentary on its possible functions, and 1) a comparison with the behavior of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The study shows that, while the behavioral repertoires of the two Pan species are fundamentally similar, interesting differences exist in their vocal repertoires, sexual behavior, and agonistic behavior. The bonobo's voice has a higher pitch, and many of its vocalizations are structurally different from homologous chimpanzee vocalizations. The greatest difference concerns the long-distance hooting calls of the two species. The bonobo's sexual behavior is much more elaborate than the chimpanzee's, including ventro-ventral copulation, and “GG-rubbing” between adult females. Sexual forms of contact seem to serve many of the reassurance and reconciliation functions fulfilled by nongenital contact forms in the chimpanzee. Finally, the bonobo's agonistic behavior is less elaborate and appears more controlled than the chimpanzee's.

abstract = {We report the physical structure and use of a distance call (high-hoot) by wild bonobos (Pan paniscus).Although spectrographic analyses reveal high structural variability, the total sample can be subdivided according to the composition of units—the presence or absence of an initial segment—and the range of the lowest harmonic. Analyses of samples from male—female pairs,vocalizing simultaneously and in close proximity, reveal that both animals utter calls in more or less precise temporal alternation but with different spectral ranges. Whether these differences are gender-specific or related to other factors, such as age or the social relations between particular individuals, is not clear. We suggest that (a) individuals of the same party may coordinate their vocal activity on both the temporal and the spectral level and (b) high hootings stimulate emission of equal vocalizations by members of other parties and may increase cohesion among community members. Comparison of a restricted number of spectrograms from known individuals indicates that bonobos may be able to adjust spectral parameters of one type of distance calls (high- hoot) according to corresponding calls of conspecifics.},

Measurement of 11 acoustic features of screams revealed differences between and within species. One-way analyses of variance and discriminant function analyses show that the calls of chimpanzees and bonobos differ primarily in spectral characteristics. Spectral features also account for acoustic differences between the sexes. These acoustic variations may be attributable to differences in body size and social dispersion between the two species and sexes. The effectiveness with which an acoustic feature could be used to discriminate the two species and female bonobos from male bonobos is negatively associated with its relative variability. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that optimal signals for group identification vary little within groups but differ widely between groups. {\textcopyright} 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {We examined (i) whether bonobos display a specific food-calling behavior when discovering a hidden food resource, (ii) whether the presence of competitors affects this behavior, and (iii) whether food quantity or gender influences its appearance. We carried out experiments (n = 108) within a captive group of eight bonobos at the Animal Park Planckendael (Mechelen, Belgium). We hid highly preferred food items (n = 7 or 25) in their enclosure and recorded vocal behavior and interactions between discoverer and group members. As a control, we gave the same number of items to the individuals when isolated from the group, a situation without potential food competition (n = 38). The only vocalization frequently uttered by the discoverer was the food peep. They uttered food peeps significantly more often when no food competition was possible. The amount of food had no significant influence on whether food peeps were uttered. The same applies to the individuals' identity or gender. Although the costs of food calling behavior seemed much higher for males, both sexes uttered food calls to the same extent. We hypothesize that males signal food presence in order to attract potential mates and are willing to give up the discovered food resource in return for sex: sex for food 'exchange. In contrast, females may vocalize to attract coalition partners. Through these coalitions, they can monopolize food resources vis-{\`{a}}-vis males. It is also possible that females have less reason to suppress food calls, since they are dominant to males. This study suggests that bonobos are able to give shaded signals about their environment and have the potential to communicate this information in order to promote their sexual strategy. {\textcopyright} 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Observations were carried out on three wild communities, with a total of 68 individuals, for 685 h. No artificial feeding was used at any stage of the study. The vocal repertoire is composed of 15 vocal units and 19 sequences. There is great variability both in the sequences and in the vocal units, and the categories are not always completely discrete. The repertoire is compared to that of captive bonobos described by De Waal. Most sequences are used in various contexts, and for each behaviour there is a complete array of sequences and their variation. The behaviour patterns observed and the sequences uttered by the animals in each context are discussed.},

abstract = {When encountering food, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and some other primates produce specific calls, whose acoustic structure covaries with the caller's food preference. For chimpanzees, there is evidence that listeners use these contingencies to guide their own foraging behaviour. Here, we investigated the vocal behaviour of another great ape, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, in response to food. We were able to distinguish acoustically five different call types given during interactions with food. These calls were not given singly, but usually as part of long and complex call sequences. We established the food preference hierarchies for 10 different individuals, housed at two different facilities. We found that the composition of call sequences produced by these individuals was not random, but was related to the type of food encountered by the caller. Significant variation in call composition was explained by taking into account the caller's individual food preferences, suggesting that bonobo food-calling sequences convey meaningful information to other group members. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {‘Contest hoots' are acoustically complex vocalisations produced by adult and subadult male bonobos (Pan paniscus). These calls are often directed at specific individuals and regularly combined with gestures and other body signals. The aim of our study was to describe the multi-modal use of this call type and to clarify its communicative and social function. To this end, we observed two large groups of bonobos, which generated a sample of 585 communicative interactions initiated by 10 different males. We found that contest hooting, with or without other associated signals, was produced to challenge and provoke a social reaction in the targeted individual, usually agonistic chase. Interestingly, ‘contest hoots' were sometimes also used during friendly play. In both contexts, males were highly selective in whom they targeted by preferentially choosing individuals of equal or higher social rank, suggesting that the calls functioned to assert social status. Multi-modal sequences were not more successful in eliciting reactions than contest hoots given alone, but we found a significant difference in the choice of associated gestures between playful and agonistic contexts. During friendly play, contest hoots were significantly more often combined with soft than rough gestures compared to agonistic challenges, while the calls' acoustic structure remained the same. We conclude that contest hoots indicate the signaller's intention to interact socially with important group members, while the gestures provide additional cues concerning the nature of the desired interaction.},

abstract = {A shared principle in the evolution of language and the development of speech is the emergence of functional flexibility, the capacity of vocal signals to express a range of emotional states independently of context and biological function. Functional flexibility has recently been demonstrated in the vocalisations of pre-linguistic human infants, which has been contrasted to the functionally fixed vocal behaviour of non-human primates. Here, we revisited the presumed chasm in functional flexibility between human and non-human primate vocal behaviour, with a study on our closest living primate relatives, the bonobo (Pan paniscus). We found that wild bonobos use a specific call type (the "peep") across a range of contexts that cover the full valence range (positive-neutral-negative) in much of their daily activities, including feeding, travel, rest, aggression, alarm, nesting and grooming. Peeps were produced in functionally flexible ways in some contexts, but not others. Crucially, calls did not vary acoustically between neutral and positive contexts, suggesting that recipients take pragmatic information into account to make inferences about call meaning. In comparison, peeps during negative contexts were acoustically distinct. Our data suggest that the capacity for functional flexibility has evolutionary roots that predate the evolution of human speech. We interpret this evidence as an example of an evolutionary early transition away from fixed vocal signalling towards functional flexibility.},

@article{Schamberg2017,
abstract = {Abstract: Many primates produce vocalizations when initiating travel. These “travel calls” are often acoustically similar to vocalizations unrelated to travel, and listeners appear to rely on a shared context with callers to correctly interpret the calls. When individuals use vocalizations to coordinate movement with out-of-sight group mates, however, such pragmatic cues are unavailable. Under these circumstances, effective communication may depend on more informative acoustic signals. Here, we investigate travel-related vocalizations that occur when callers and listeners cannot see one another: long-distance calls given by wild bonobos (Pan paniscus). We find that production of a specific call combination, the “low hoot-high hoot,” is more likely than a high hoot alone to be produced prior to travel. Furthermore, the low hoot-high hoot combination is more likely to result in inter-party recruitment—that is, individuals from other parties are more likely to approach the caller. We also compare these observations with previous research and find that bonobos appear to use distinct call combinations to facilitate specific movement patterns common in fission-fusion social structures. These results suggest that use of call combinations allow bonobos to convey more specific information than do single call types alone and that this additional information allows for effective communication between out-of-sight parties. Significance statement: When an animal hears a conspecific vocalization, it is able to respond appropriately by integrating information about the call type itself and the context in which it was given. Vocalizations produced by out-of-sight individuals, therefore, present a challenge: how can a listener respond appropriately with only partial information about the context of the call? In situations where distant bonobos are communicating with one another, we find that call combinations are potentially more informative to listeners than single call types alone. The use of call combinations in such situations may allow listeners to respond appropriately to conspecific vocalizations even with ambiguous information about the context in which the call was produced.},

abstract = {Comparing the communicative abilities of humans and great apes is a commonly used research strategy to understand the evolutionary foundation of modern human language. The ability to combine signals from different communicative modes (vocal, gestural, facial, etc.) is a universal and important feature of human language that is shared with great apes, although rarely investigated. Research on apes' signal combination has usually studied the frequency, distribution, effectiveness, and function of combinations in comparison with single signals, but only seldom have studies addressed their functional specificity, i.e., their ability to convey specific signallers' goals within contexts. Here, I suggest a new methodological approach to the investigation of functional specificity of signals, which consists of focusing on one call type and exploring its various patterns of production when combined with gestures. I illustrate the different methodological steps with a case study on infant bonobos' combinations of ‘Pout moan' calls with gestures in the context of infant-to-mother requests. The descriptive results indicate that at least three combinations seem functionally specific, i.e., specific to the infants' desired goals. It suggests that combinations can be functionally specific from a young age and that learning how to combine signals efficiently might occur early in ontogeny. This suggested approach might provide insight to the on-going debate regarding the mechanisms underpinning the learning process of successful signal production and potentially further our understanding of the evolution of the combinatorial characteristics of human communication.},

abstract = {Vocalizations often contain both ‘dynamic' information, related to short-term fluctuations in the individual's emotional states, and ‘static' information, related to long-term attributes such as age, sex, weight and body size which define an ‘individual vocal signature'. While both types of information may be of functional value to receivers, dynamic information requires acoustic versatility, while static information depends on acoustic stability. Here we investigated whether an individual vocal signature is present across the vocal repertoire of the bonobo, Pan paniscus. First, the analysis of the acoustic structure of its five most common tonal vocalizations emphasized the highly graded structure of its repertoire. We then evaluated the reliability of identity information across these call types. The results show that, while all call types supported information related to identity, the reliability of these vocal signatures was not consistent along the graded vocal continuum. Caller identity was strongly encoded at one end of the acoustic gradation (high-hoot) and decreased from bark, soft bark, peep-yelp to peep calls. Strikingly, the reliability of the individual signature thus decreased from calls used in high-arousal contexts to those used in low-arousal contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an acoustic gradation that codes for ‘dynamic' information can be accompanied by variation in the ‘static' information that supports vocal individuality.},

abstract = {Recordings were made of 193 pant hoots given by 6 adult males during ad lib sampling over a 16-month period in 1988 and 1989. The presence or absence of a let-down phase, and acoustic measures of the let-down and climax phases of the calls, were compared for different call contexts to determine if an acoustically distinct pant hoot was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. The greatest proportion of pant hoots with a let-down (LD pant hoots) occurred immediately upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, LD pant hoots also occurred at other times during feeding bouts. The frequency and duration of the first exhaled element of 19 let-down phases were measured, and four measures were made on the highest pitched element of 49 climax phases: duration, maximum and minimum frequencies, and average frequency. No differences were found in these acoustic measures that distinguished calls given immediately upon arrival at a food tree from calls given later during feeding bouts. Thus no evidence was found that an acoustically distinct pant hoot was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, the analyses did suggest that identifiable pant hoot variants are given in different social contexts. The proportion of LD pant hoots decreased in more interactive social contexts, and other acoustic features may be available to distinguish this pant hoot variant at long distances. We suggest that different pant hoot variants might broadcast information specific to social, as opposed to ecological, context.},

abstract = {Recordings and behavioral observations of wild chimpanzees were made over a 2-year period in the Kibale National Park, Uganda (Kanyawara and Ngogo communities) to investigate patterns of acoustic variability in long-distance calls. The phrase structures of pant hoots, the species-typical loud call given predominantly by adult males, were analyzed. Analysis revealed that the build-up phrase was frequently absent from the pant hoots of Kibale chimpanzees. By contrast, analysis of published data on Gombe and Mahale chimpanzees (Tanzania) indicated that these animals typically included the build-up in their calls. These results were interpreted as evidence for phrase-level differences between populations in the acoustic morphology of this compound call. Data on age and sex differences in the context of production of pant hoots were analyzed, and their relevance to the possibility that aspects of pant hoot acoustic morphology are learned is discussed. Adult males initiated pant hoots more than subadult males, and adult males joined other pant hooting individuals with pant hoots more than subadult males did. It is suggested that younger males may pant hoot with specific adult males preferentially and that this may affect the development of their pant hoot acoustic morphologies. A peculiar pant hoot variant previously reported from Gombe, the whimper hoot, is described from Kibale. The production of this call by low-ranking individuals suggests that there are social constraints on pant hooting in the chimpanzee community. Ideas concerning the effect of social relationships on interpopulation variability in vocal signals are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Individual primates typically produce acoustically distinct calls. To investigate the factors that facilitate the evolution of individual vocal signatures, we examined two components of the call repertoire of chimpanzees: the pant hoot and pant grunt. Pant hoots are long-distance signals whose recipients can be several hundred meters away, while pant grunts are short-range calls given to conspecifics within close visual range. Given their markedly different contexts of emission, we predicted that natural selection would favor the elaboration of individually distinctive acoustic features in pant hoots compared with pant grunts. Analyses of nine acoustic features revealed that pant hoots are more stereotyped within-individuals and variable between-individuals than pant grunts. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that selection may act to encode varying degrees of individuality in different components of the vocal repertoire of a single species.},

abstract = {We recorded 'pant-hoot' vocalizations from male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, housed in two captive facilities in the U.S.A., Lion Country Safari and North Carolina Zoological Park. Acoustic analysis revealed significant differences between the groups in the temporal patterning of the calls. Because the captive males within each group are from diverse origins, within-group similarity in pant-hoot structure could not have resulted from genetic similarity of the callers. In addition, there were no obvious differences in housing conditions that could have caused the between-group differences. Instead, the results suggest that the calls in each group converged in structure as a consequence of vocal learning. Within-group variation in call structure of the captive groups was similar to that found in a group of wild Ugandan chimpanzees (Kanyawara study group, Kibale National Park), suggesting the presence of species-specific constraints on this call within which different populations can converge on local variants. In addition, an acoustically novel pant-hoot variant that was introduced by one male to the Lion County Safari colony spread to five other males in the same colony. This suggests that chimpanzees may also be able to modify the frequency parameters of their calls through learning.},

abstract = {Context-specific calls, which have a distinct acoustic structure and are selectively produced in specific contexts, are a prerequisite for calls that function referentially. Functionally referential calls, which convey information to conspecifics about objects and events in the external world, have been found in a number of species, notably primates. Evidence of context-specific calls in apes, however, is largely absent. We analysed whether the barks of wild male chimpanzees in the Ta{\"{i}} Forest, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, are context specific. We examined the acoustic structure of barks, and other calls produced in association with barks, in six contexts, using discriminant function analysis. Chimpanzees produced context-specific signals in two ways. First, they produced two acoustically graded bark subtypes, in hunt and snake contexts, respectively. Second, they produced context-specific signal combinations of barks with acoustically different call types or drums. These signal combinations increased specificity levels in three of the six contexts to over 90%, a level similar to the classic vervet monkey, Cercophithecus aethiops, predator alarm calls. Furthermore, specific chimpanzee signals were produced in contexts other than alarm, such as travel and hunting, where the potential benefits of evolving specific calls are less obvious. These signals may convey specific context information to listeners, and thus function referentially; however, to confirm this, analyses of listeners' responses are required. The results show that two strategies for producing context-specific signals seem to have evolved in a species other than humans: chimpanzees produce context-specific bark subtypes and context-specific signal combinations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Vocal learning, where animals can modify the structure of their vocalizations as a result of experience, has been found in a range of birds and mammals. Although vocal learning is a fundamental aspect of developing spoken language, there is as yet little evidence that vocal learning occurs in primates. Here we examine whether vocal learning may occur in chimpanzees. We analysed whether wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, of four communities living in a similar habitat in the Ta{\"{i}} Forest, C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, developed community specific pant hoots. If so, we expected males of three contiguous communities to have distinct pant hoots, while pant hoots of males from a fourth, distant community, located 70 km away, should only differ from those of the contiguous communities by chance. Our analysis confirmed these expectations. In addition, the acoustic distances between the pant hoots of pairs of individuals did not correlate with the genetic relatedness of those pairs, where genetic relatedness was determined using nuclear DNA analysis. Thus, neither habitat nor genetic differences accounted for the observation that there were acoustic differences in the pant hoot structure of males living in neighbouring communities, but not in those of males from a distant community. This suggests that chimpanzees may actively modify pant hoots to be different from their neighbours, providing support for the vocal learning hypothesis.},

@article{Notman2005,
abstract = {There have been several previous studies of the loud, long-distance call of chimpanzees, termed a 'pant hoot'. Some have explored the possibility that there are acoustically distinct subtypes of pant hoots that communicate to distant listeners different information about the caller's behaviour, or ecological and social circumstances. However, results to date have been either inconclusive or conflicting. To help resolve these issues, we undertook research on pant hoots produced by wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schwienfurthii, living in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. In this paper, we report the results of acoustic analysis of 201 pant hoot series produced by seven adult males. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify key dimensions of structural variation in the calls, which were then related to a large set of behavioural, social and ecological variables associated with call production. Although there was little evidence for distinctive pant hoot subtypes according to many of the social and ecological dimensions traditionally recognized, a number of significant patterns were identified. Specifically, pant hoots were produced with higher probability at abundant food sources, and they were more likely to contain a 'let-down' phase when produced in specific behavioural contexts, such as travelling and upon arrival at a food source. In addition, pant hoots produced while travelling along the ground in small parties prior to joining-up with other community members were consistently different from all other pant hoots, varying reliably in the fundamental frequency of their build-up elements, the tonal quality of climax elements and in the presence of a let-down phase. We discuss the possible mechanistic bases for these differences in the pattern of calling and detailed spectral structure of the calls and consider the implications for referential communication. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are unusual among primates in that they express their social position with a unique vocal signal, the pant-grunt. The call is only produced when encountering a higher-ranking group member and has thus been interpreted as a 'greeting' signal. We monitored the calling behaviour of nine adult females in a group of free-ranging chimpanzees, the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda, when encountering higher-ranking adult males. We found that call production was by no means rigid, but that calls were given only if certain social conditions were met. Although all adult males received pant-grunts from females, the alpha male received a significantly larger proportion of calls. The number of pant-grunts given to males was not correlated with their hierarchical position or with the level of anticipated aggression. Instead, females were significantly more likely to vocalize to other males if the alpha male was absent, suggesting that their calling behaviour was moderated by social inhibition. The presence of the alpha female had a similar yet weaker inhibitory effect. Social inhibition was further increased with increasing numbers of bystanders, especially males. Our results thus demonstrate that chimpanzees use their 'greeting' signals flexibly by taking into account the social fabric of their community. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Previous research on a number of species has indicated that food-associated calls are relatively widespread in animal communication, and the production of these calls can be influenced by both ecological and social factors. Here, we investigate the factors influencing the production of food-associated calls in wild chimpanzees and examine whether male chimpanzees produce food-associated calls selectively in the presence of important social partners. Male chimpanzees form stable long-term social relationships with each other, and these social bonds are vital in enabling a range of cooperative activities, such as group hunting and territory defence. Our data show that males were significantly more likely to produce food-associated calls if an important social partner was nearby, regardless of the size of the audience or the presence of oestrus females. Call production was also mediated by the size of the food patch and by whether or not the food could be monopolised. The presence of important social partners explained most of the variation in male calling behaviour, indicating that food-associated calls are socially directed and serve a bonding function.},

abstract = {If primates were capable of vocalizing to inform a receiver about an external entity, it would represent an important element of continuity with human language. We tested experimentally whether chimpanzee rough grunts, which function to refer to food, are produced selectively, indicating voluntary control, and whether they are directed at specific individuals. These are prerequisites for a system capable of actively informing others about external events. We conducted a field playback experiment in which we presented silently feeding male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, with arrival pant hoots of a familiar group member. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to respond with food calls to the simulated arrival of an individual with whom the caller had a high rather than low level of friendship and where there was a large rather than small positive dominance rank difference between the individuals (i.e. caller was lower ranking). We concluded that chimpanzee food calls are not simply reflexive responses to food, but can be selectively directed at socially important individuals. Our findings are thus inconsistent with traditional views of primate vocalizations as inflexibly and indiscriminately produced. Instead, our results indicate that great apes can produce semantically meaningful calls in a highly selective, recipient-directed manner. Further research is needed to test whether chimpanzees use this flexible system to inform ignorant individuals about food, but the prerequisites to support this type of communication seem to be present. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Determining the intentionality of primate communication is critical to understanding the evolution of human language. Although intentional signalling has been claimed for some great ape gestural signals, comparable evidence is currently lacking for their vocal signals. We presented wild chimpanzees with a python model and found that two of three alarm call types exhibited characteristics previously used to argue for intentionality in gestural communication. These alarm calls were: (i) socially directed and given to the arrival of friends, (ii) associated with visual monitoring of the audience and gaze alternations, and (iii) goal directed, as calling only stopped when recipients were safe from the predator. Our results demonstrate that certain vocalisations of our closest living relatives qualify as intentional signals, in a directly comparable way to many great ape gestures. We conclude that our results undermine a central argument of gestural theories of language evolution and instead support a multimodal origin of human language.},

@article{Watson2015,
abstract = {One standout feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols, or words. Exploring the phylogenetic origins of this capacity is therefore key to a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of language. While non-human primates can produce vocalizations that refer to external objects in the environment, it is generally accepted that their acoustic structure is fixed and a product of arousal states [1]. Indeed, it has been argued that the apparent lack of flexible control over the structure of referential vocalizations represents a key discontinuity with language [2]. Here, we demonstrate vocal learning in the acoustic structure of referential food grunts in captive chimpanzees. We found that, following the integration of two groups of adult chimpanzees, the acoustic structure of referential food grunts produced for a specific food converged over 3 years. Acoustic convergence arose independently of preference for the food, and social network analyses indicated this only occurred after strong affiliative relationships were established between the original subgroups. We argue that these data represent the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalization from conspecifics. Our findings indicate that primate referential call structure is not simply determined by arousal and that the socially learned nature of referential words in humans likely has ancient evolutionary origins.},

@article{Fedurek2017,
abstract = {Background: Vocal sequences - utterances consisting of calls produced in close succession - are common phenomena in animal communication. While many studies have explored the adaptive benefits of producing such sequences, very little is known about how the costs and constraints involved in their production affect their form. Here, we investigated this issue in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) pant hoot, a long and structurally complex vocal sequence comprising four acoustically distinct phases - introduction, build-up, climax and let-down. Results: We found that in each of these phases, and for the sequence as a whole, there was a negative relationship between the number of calls produced and their average duration. There was also a negative relationship between the total duration of some adjacent phases. Significant relationships between the fundamental frequency of calls and their number or duration were found for some phases of the sequence, but the direction of these relationships differed between particular phases. Conclusions: These results indicate that there are trade-offs in terms of signal duration at two levels in pant-hoot production: between call number and duration, and between the relative durations of successive phases. These trade-offs are likely to reflect biomechanical constraints on vocal sequence production. Phase-specific trade-offs also appear to occur between fundamental frequency and call number or duration, potentially reflecting that different phases of the sequence are associated with distinct types of information, linked in different ways to call pitch. Overall, this study highlights the important role of costs and constraints in shaping the temporal and acoustic structure of animal vocal sequences.},

@article{Dezecache2020,
abstract = {How did human language evolve from earlier forms of communication? One way to address this question is to compare prelinguistic human vocal behavior with nonhuman primate calls. Here, an important finding has been that, prior to speech, human infant vocal behavior exhibits functional flexibility, the capacity of producing protophones that are not tied to one specific function. Nonhuman primate vocal behavior, by contrast, is comparably inflexible, with different call types tied to specific functions. Our research challenges the generality of this claim, with new findings of flexible vocal behavior in infant chimpanzees. We used artificial intelligence consisting of automated feature extraction and supervised learning algorithms to analyze grunt and whimper vocalizations from free-ranging infants during their first year of life. We found that grunt production was highly flexible occurring in positive, neutral and negative circumstances, as already shown in human infants. We also found acoustic variants of grunts produced in different affective contexts, suggesting gradation within this vocal category. By contrast, the second most common call type of infant chimpanzees, the whimpers, was produced in only one affective context in line with standard models of nonhuman primate vocal behavior. We concluded that the most common chimpanzee vocalization, the grunt, qualifies as functionally flexible, suggesting that evolution of vocal functional flexibility occurred before the split between the Homo and Pan lineages.},

abstract = {Speech is a human hallmark, but its evolutionary origins continue to defy scientific explanation. Recently, the open–close mouth rhythm of 2–7 Hz (cycles/second) characteristic of all spoken languages has been identified in the orofacial signals of several nonhuman primate genera, including orangutans, but evidence from any of the African apes remained missing. Evolutionary continuity for the emergence of speech is, thus, still inconclusive. To address this empirical gap, we investigated the rhythm of chimpanzee lip-smacks across four populations (two captive and two wild). We found that lip-smacks exhibit a speech-like rhythm at approximately 4 Hz, closing a gap in the evidence for the evolution of speech-rhythm within the primate order. We observed sizeable rhythmic variation within and between chimpanzee populations, with differences of over 2 Hz at each level. This variation did not result, however, in systematic group differences within our sample. To further explore the phylogenetic and evolutionary perspective on this variability, inter-individual and inter-population analyses will be necessary across primate species producing mouth signals at speech-like rhythm. Our findings support the hypothesis that speech recruited ancient primate rhythmic signals and suggest that multi-site studies may still reveal new windows of understanding about these signals' use and production along the evolutionary timeline of speech.},
