The [summary_vocal_repertoire_great_apes](summary_great_ape_vocal_repoertoires.csv) table gives a summary of the published data on (non-humna) great ape vocalizations.

The references are given in [references.bib](references.bib). The main references are given for a specific call, i.e., where it was first descriibed and then who provided information about it, e.g., Hardus et al. (2009a) provide additional information about the orangutan bark, which was initially described by MacKinnon et al. (1974).

Additional references not listed in the summary table refer to the classification of calls, e.g., Harcourt et al. (1993) describe gorilla vocalizations as syllable and non-syllable; Hedwig et al. (2014) report a syllable vs non-syllable group classification.
