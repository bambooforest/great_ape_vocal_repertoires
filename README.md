# Great_apes_vocal_repertoires

Data and code Great apes' vocal repertoires

The "Summary_vocal_repertoire_great_apes" table gathers the description of Great apes' vocalizations;

In the reference section, I listed the main references of the specific call, which means, who describe first the specific vocalization and who give some other information about it (i.e. Hardus et al., 2009a give other information about orangutans' bark, which is already described by MacKinnon et al., 1974).

References listed in the Reference section and not listed in the Table refer to the classification of calls that is overcome by recent research (i.e. Harcourt et al., 1993 described Gorilla vocalizations as syllable and non-syllable, Hedwig et al., 2014 found that syllable and non-syllable is a group classification that we can make of the different Gorillas' calls).
